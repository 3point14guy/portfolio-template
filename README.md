# Portfolio Template

Use this template to structure your Portfolios.

# User Stories to Get Started With
-  As a non-technical HR manager, I want to quickly evaluate whether this candidate has the skills and experience to fill an open position at my company.
-  As a mid-level engineer, I want to evaluate a junior developer’s coding skills by reviewing their projects and reading their code.
-  As a friend of the person who built this portfolio, I want to understand what they do as a developer and what they have created.

NOTE: There are lots more, but let's start with these!

# Portfolios must include these sections:
-  About Me: Short blurb explaining who you are, and some background info
-  Skills: All the skills you have that may be helpful on the job
-  Contact info (email, LinkedIn, GitHub, city)
-  Resume view & download
-  Showcase your GA projects (more details below)
-  Blog posts (2-4) — Link to a medium account, or these could be built in native to the app if you really want bonus points!

# Optional:
-  Personal hobbies/interests
-  Professional Timeline (a visual representation of your work history)
-  Additional work samples (visual design, writing samples, a link to your photography blog)
-  Social profiles if relevant (Twitter, instagram, if they highlight you professionally, not just what your meals look like)
-  Could include phone number and mailing address, but not necessary

# Notes on highlighting your GA projects:
-  Include links to live site as well as front-end and back-end repos
-  Describe both the functionality of the site as well as what technologies you used to build it.
-  Talk about your process for building this app. If you have a blog post that goes into detail for each project, link to that post.
-  As you add your GA projects to your portfolio, make sure they are user-friendly to an unacquainted visitor.
-  The home page should explain the site’s functionality
-  Random users might not want to sign up/sign in. You should either put dummy credentials on the homepage that they can use (and explain that), or make sure they can interact with the site without signing up.
-  Clean up the data you’ve entered on the site as you were testing it.

## A Quick Note About Design:
If you’ve got design chops, use them. You have an opportunity to impress a wide audience with both your coding skills and your design abilities with this site.
If you are not a strong designer, that’s okay too! Don’t try to be something that you’re not on this site. Keep your design simple, or mock up your site based off of another site you have seen that looks great. Get feedback from colleagues (especially non-developers and non-designers) to make sure it doesn’t look terrible. Keep it neutral and focus on producing good projects.




Be sure to include a recent [`LICENSE`](LICENSE) and Markdown linter
configuration ([`.remarkrc`](.remarkrc)). Also, include an appropriate
`.gitignore`; these are usually found in specific technology templates, for
example [js-template](https://www.github.com/ga-wdi-boston/js-template).

## Prerequisites

-   Topics with which developers should be familiar with.
-   Prerequisites are "just-in-time", so if I have a prerequisite that mentions
    Sass, I would **not** need to include CSS as a prerequisite.
-   [Links to previous materials](https://www.github.com/ga-wdi-boston/example)
    are often useful.

## Objectives

By the end of this, developers should be able to:

-   Write objectives that focus on demonstrating knowledge.
-   Write learning objectives that begin with an [imperative
    verb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_mood).
-   Avoid objectives that start with "Use" or "Understand".
-   Rewrite objecives that begin with "Use" by inverting sentence structure.
-   End each objective with a period.
-   Write objectives on the whiteboard so they can be referenced during a talk.

## Preparation

1.  Fork and clone this repository.
 [FAQ](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/meta/wiki/ForkAndClone)
1.  Create a new branch, `training`, for your work.
1.  Checkout to the `training` branch.
1.  Install dependencies with `npm install`.

Better preparation instructions may be found as
[snippets](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/instructors/tree/master/snippets).

It's a good idea to have students do these steps while you're writing objectives
on the whiteboard.

## Leading Topic Heading

Here is where the talk begins. If you have not already included framing above,
it's appropriate to put it here. Link to introductory articles or documentation.
Motivate the next section.

Demos, exercises, and labs are labelled as such, followed by a colon and a
description of the activity starting with an [imperative
verb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_mood).

## Demo: Write a Demo

Demos are demonstrations, and developers should give their full attention to
them. It's a great time for them to take notes about important concepts before
applying them in an exercise.

Demos correspond to the "I do" portion of scaffolding from consultant training.

## Code-Along: Write an Code-Along

During the code-along, developers should apply concepts covered in the previous
demo, led by the consultant.
This is their first chance to generalize concepts introduced. Exercises should
be very focused, and flow natural into a lab.

Exercises correspond to the "We do" portion of scaffolding from consultant
training.

## Lab: Write a Lab

During labs, developers get to demonstrate their understanding of concepts from
demos and applied knowledge from exercises. Labs are an opportunity for
developers to build confidence, and also serve as a diagnostic tool for
consultants to evaluate developer understanding.

Labs should be timed explicitly using a timer. When estimating the time it will
take to complete a lab, it is better to overestimate. During labs, consultants
should circle the room and interact with developers, noting patterns and
prompting with hints on how to complete the lab. If developers end early, a
consultant may stop the lab timer. If developers do not finish in time, a
consultant may give more time at her discretion based on current talk pace, the
current estimate for the talk, and the importance of completing the lab while
consultant support is available.

Labs correspond to the "You do" portion of scaffolding from consultant
training.

## Additional Resources

-   Any useful links should be included in the talk material where the link is
    first referenced.
-   Additional links for further study or exploration are appropriate in this
    section.
-   Links to important parts of documentation not covered during the talk, or
    tools tangentially used but not part of the focus of the talk, are also
    appropriate.
